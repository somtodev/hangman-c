## A Short Story

I have always wondered how a computer was built from scratch, just pure maths to a device with boxes and texts. I know I wouldn't feel as smart as every one of those legends who made it possible for me to share this today, in other words those who provided a means to make the world a global village.

But, one thing I know for sure, is that I would try my best to make something life changing from what they have provided me/us with.
